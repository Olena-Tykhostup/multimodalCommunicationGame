# Experimental software for multimodal communication game

Open 'exper.html' in a web browser on two computers (tested in firefox).

You can select what condition they're in, their role and the order of presented stimuli. There are two order sets, a pair playing together should be given the same order number.  Then the participant can click "Next round" to begin.

Click one of the 'cover images' (A, B, C) to reveal the image or play the audio.  Images disappear after 1 second.

At the end of the experiment, the results are pasted in a text box at the bottom of the page (in csv format) - you can copy and paste this into a text file.  The program saves this text to a Cookie called "data", in case the page is reloaded.   Hitting the F2 key will show the data currently stored in the cookie.

The idea is that you run one condition, then reload the page and run the same participants in another condition. 

There is no communication between the two computers, the program relies on the players moving on to the next round in synch.
