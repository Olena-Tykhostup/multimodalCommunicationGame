# Introduction
This document provides R code for reproducing the test of the relative codability of the senses.  We use mixed effects modelling to test the influence of language and domain.  The full model included random intercepts for stimulus, domain, language, and the interaction between language and domain.  Log-likelihood comparison was used to compare the full model to a model without one of those intercepts
## Data
The main data comes from `../data/DiversityIndices_ND.csv`, which includes the Simpson's diversity index, counting no-responses as unique responses.  Each row lists the codability of a particular stimulus for a particular community.  The variables are:
-  `Language`: Language/Community name
-  `domain`: Sense domain
-  `Stimulus.code`: Identity of the stimulus
-  `simpson.diversityIndex`: Simpson's diversity index
-  `shannon.diversityIndex`: Shannon diversity index
-  `N`: Number of responses
-  `BnL.diversityIndex`:  Brown & Lenneberg diversity index
-  `mean.number.of.words`:  Mean number of words in full response

# Intro
The main data used in this analysis comes from `../../data/FinalSignalData.csv` (compiled by  `analyseData.R`).  Each row represents one signal, but this script only keeps one signal per trial, and the rest of the analysis is on the trial-by-trial level.  The variables in the data are as follows (some are calculated in the script below):
-  X: ID
-  filename: Filename of the ELAN file
-  dyadNumber: ID of the participant dyad
-  condition: Stimuli type (Auditory or Visual)
-  game: Game number (0-3)
-  trial: Trial number (0-15)
-  target: Target stimuli shown to the director
-  choice: Meaning chosen by the matcher
-  correct: True if the matcher's choice is correct
-  trialStart, trialEnd, trialLength: Start, end and length of trial in milliseconds
-  trialValue:  A unique string that represents data from the trial.  Numbers in the curly brackets represent the choices given to the matcher
-  startOfNextTrial: Timestamp for next trial, used in processing the data.
-  turnStart, turnEnd, turnLength: the start, end and length of the turn in milliseconds.
-  signalStart, signalEnd, signalLength: the start, end and length of the signal.
-  signalType:  Annotation value in ELAN, not meaningful
-  tiralString: Unique string to identify trial
-  modalityCondition:  The condition for the dyad (multi= multimodal, visual=gesture only, vocal=vocal only)
-  playerId:  Unique ID for the participant producing the signal
-  itemId:  Unique ID for the target stimulus
-  turnString:  Unque ID for the turn
-  matcherResponds:  Does matcher take a turn in this trial?
-  matcherResponds.cumulative: The (scaled) number of previous trials that a has responded.
-  T1Length, T1Length.log:  Length and log length of the director's first turn.
-  trialTotal: Number of trials played so far, scaled (and centered) to represent number of games played.
-  firstBlock:  Block order
-  incorrect:  Was the matcher's choice incorrect?
-  multimodal:  Was the director's first turn multimodal?

# Mixed models
Make a series of models with random effects for dyad, director (nested within dyad) and item.
Not all random slopes are appropriate.  For example, items are used in only one stimulus condition, so a random slope for condition by item is not appropriate.  Similarly, each dyad only plays in one modality condition.
It is reasonable to have a random slope for trial by dyad, but this caused unreliable model convergence, so is not included.
The final random slopes were for condition and incorrectness by dyad/player, and modality condition by item.
```{r models, cache=TRUE}
# No fixed effects
m0 =  lmer(trialLength.log ~ 1 +
(1 + condition + incorrect |dyadNumber/playerId) +
(1 + modalityCondition|itemId),
data=d, REML = FALSE)
```
Now we add a series of possible confounding factors such as whether the matcher responds.  We add the main experimental factors at the end to ensure that they're really contributing to the model over and above the confounds.
