# Intro 

This script uses data compiled by *analyseData.R*.

## Load libraries

```{r warning=F}
library(lme4)
library(sjPlot)
```

```{r echo=F}
try(setwd("~/Documents/MPI/ViniciusMultimodal/multimodalCommunicationGame/experiment/analysis/R/"))
```

## Load data

```{r}
d = read.csv("../../data/FinalSignalData.csv")
```

We don't need info on every signal in each turn, just the trial time.  Keep only 1st signal in each trial.

```{r}
d = d[!duplicated(d$trialString),]
```
