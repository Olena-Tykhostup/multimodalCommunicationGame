# Data

The folder `data/codedEaf/` contains all the [Elan](https://tla.mpi.nl/tools/tla-tools/elan/) annotation files (EAF) for the final annotations, which aligns the video data with timing of trials (automatically added) and signalling (human coded).

The final data:

-  `Final_Turn_data.csv`: Data on a turn-by-turn level
-  `FinalSignalData.csv`: Data on a signal-by-signal level

# Processing and analysis

## Aligning timing of the video and experimental program

The script `processing/addTrialTimesToEAF_multiBlock.py` takes an [Elan](https://tla.mpi.nl/tools/tla-tools/elan/) file of the video, with a tier called 'synch' with two annotations:

-  "player 1 start" and 
-  "player 2 start"

Which marks the start of the audio of the web program.  And also take the csv file generated by the program add annotations to the elan file to mark out trial boundaries.

## Converting ELAN data to tabular data

Extract the data from the elan files, make csv files.  This python file uses the `pympi` library for python ([https://github.com/dopefishh/pympi](https://github.com/dopefishh/pympi)).

```
cd processing
python3 eaf2csv_multimodal_B.py
```

Extract measurements and create final data frame.  This loads the data in ../data/csv/*.csv and compiles it into a single file, plus some handy summary variables.

```
cd ../analysis/R/
R analyseData.R
R analyseTurnLevelData.R
```


## Main statistical analyses

Run analyses (in `analysis/R/`):

-  `statistics_Accuracy.Rmd`
-  `statistics_Efficiency.Rmd`


Results are stored in the `results` folder.

Reliability of coding compared to second coder: `analysis/R/reliability.R`
